# fo.ai â€“ Cloud Cost Intelligence Platform

**Version:** `v0.1.3`  
**Built by:** A team that got tired of surprise AWS bills

---

## What's This All About?

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ We built `fo.ai` because we were spending way too much time staring at AWS bills and wondering where all our money went. You know that feeling when you get that monthly invoice and think "wait, what's this $200 charge for?" Yeah, we've been there too.

`fo.ai` is our attempt to make cloud cost optimization less painful. It's like having a smart friend who actually understands AWS pricing and can tell you exactly which instances are just sitting there burning money.

## Usage Examples

### Web Interface

The web interface provides an intuitive way to interact with the platform. Simply type your questions in natural language:

- "Which EC2 instances are underutilized and costing money?"
- "Analyze instance i-1234567890abcdef0 for optimization opportunities"
- "Check my S3 bucket 'production-logs' for lifecycle policy recommendations"
- "Show me the top 5 cost optimization opportunities across all services"

### Command Line Interface

For power users and automation scenarios, the CLI provides comprehensive functionality:

```bash
# Quick cost analysis
python foai_cli.py ask "How can I reduce my EC2 costs?"

# Streaming analysis with real-time updates
python foai_cli.py ask "Show me underutilized instances" --stream

# System status check
python foai_cli.py status

# Server management
python foai_cli.py server start all
python foai_cli.py server stop all

# View application logs
python foai_cli.py logs api
python foai_cli.py logs ui
```

### Global CLI Access

For convenience, add the CLI to your system PATH:

```bash
# Add to your shell configuration (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
alias foai="python /full/path/to/foai_cli.py"

# Then use from anywhere
foai ask "What's driving up my AWS costs?"
foai server start all
```
